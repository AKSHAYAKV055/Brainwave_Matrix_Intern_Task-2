# Password Strength Checker
This project is a Password Strength Checker tool that helps users evaluate the strength of their passwords based on various factors like length, complexity, and uniqueness. The tool provides feedback on password strength with a numerical score and a textual description (e.g., "Weak", "Good", "Strong"). It also includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, making it user-friendly and easy to interact with.This project is a Password Strength Checker tool that helps users evaluate the strength of their passwords based on various factors like length, complexity, and uniqueness. The tool provides feedback on password strength with a numerical score and a textual description (e.g., "Weak", "Good", "Strong"). It also includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, making it user-friendly and easy to interact with.

Features:
- Password Analysis: Checks the password length, complexity (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, special characters), and common password uniqueness.
- Score-based Feedback: Calculates and provides a numerical strength score (from 0 to 10) based on the password's characteristics.
- User-friendly GUI: A graphical interface using Tkinter that allows users to enter a password and receive immediate feedback.
- Real-time Feedback (Optional): (Can be added later) Provide password strength updates as the user types.

 Project Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to help users understand the importance of strong passwords, provide feedback for improving password security, and encourage the creation of complex, unique passwords. Itâ€™s a simple yet effective tool for both casual users and security enthusiasts.

Technologies Used:
- Python: The core language used for logic and GUI implementation.
- Tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface.
- Regular Expressions: Used for password complexity checks (e.g., uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters).

Run the Program:

- Make sure you have Python 3 and Tkinter installed.
- Run the following command to start the password strength checker:

python3 password_strength_checker_gui.py

Enter a Password:
- Enter any password in the input field.
- Click the "Check Strength" button to receive feedback on your password strength.

Future Enhancements:
- Real-time Password Strength: Implement a feature that updates password strength feedback as the user types.
- Password Generator: Add a tool to generate strong, random passwords.
- Integration with APIs: Implement a feature to check if the password has been exposed in data breaches (e.g., via "Have I Been Pwned").
- Unit Tests: Add unit tests to verify the password strength logic.
